        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>For this learning outcome I made a Portfolio website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the landing page I used a parallax effect for the moon, the stars and my name. I used a YouTube video to see how to make a parallax effect.<br><br><img src="images/JSCode.png" id="Code" style="width: 500px"><br><br>The first part ensures that I'm making a new variable for every picture I have on my landing page with the ID I made for them.<br>The second part ensures that all the "IDs" or Pictures move a certain amount of pixels when I scroll down and to which side it has to go when I scroll. <br><br>I went to Maikel to ask feedback on my JavaScript because in my third review I got the feedback that it could be easier written. Maikel told me that I had to change the 'let' into 'const' of the parallax effect, because I only use them once, and I could delete the Semicolon because they aren't used in JS anymore. So I changed that.<br><br>
            I learned how to make a parallax effect on my website and I am also proud that I made it work.<br>I learned how I to make sure that when I press a button the screen would scroll down instead of going to a new page, and what the difference is in the code with when you press the button and you go to a new page.<br><br>
            <strong>Version Control</strong><br> I made a Repository for my website and pushed my code to Github. I didn't really know how it worked so I did research first and asked a friend.<br> Here's the link to my <a href="https://github.com/Sjowel/Portfolio/commits/main/" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>.</p><br>
        <h3>Project 3: Development</h3>
        <h3>Project x</h3><br>
            <strong>  GitHub</strong>
            <p>For my Project X I wanted to get more familiar with Github and understand more of it because I haven't really used it before. So this project was the perfect opportunity to do it. <br> Julian (A friend of mine) knows a lot about Git so he learned me the basics. When I started working with it I realised how nice it was to use it, and to look back to the commits which were made so it was clear what was already done.<br><br>
                <img src="images/Commits.png" id="commits" style="width: 500px"><br><br>
                Here is the link to my commits from <a href="https://github.com/Sjowel/ProjectX/commits/main/" target="_blank"><strong>Project X.</strong></a><br><br>
            I've learned how to use GitHub and how to keep track of the things you've already done for your website and that it is very useful to use for the development projects.<br><br></p>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>
            <p>I also wanted to get more familiar with JavaScript, because I never really used it in the websites I made because I didn't really know how to use it.</p>
