        <h2>Personal Leadership</h2>
        <p>"You take the initiative in asking for, and reflecting on, feedback. You identify your own core values as the basis for your study career and professional development."</p><br><br>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>I want to continue with this study and see where it is going to bring me. 
          I like this profile and I want to find out what more things I can do with it.<br><br> 
          <strong>Future</strong><br>
          In the future I don't know what I want to be yet but I think I will know further in this 
          study. Right now I prefer the designing and development part.<br><br><strong>Reflection</strong><br> I also reflected on my work and what I personally could do better in previous projects and tried to apply this to my recent work. The main part I wanted to work on is to organize my stuff better, and to not do everything last minute. 
          I think it is better to write down what I want to do and make a planning so I can see what I have to do, because now I'm just doing stuff and finish it last minute, and sometimes I forget things because I haven't written it down.<br>I also have to ask more feedback because I forget that and then I don't know if my work is good enough.
        <br><br>What I think I do good is that I know what I want and how I want it, So normally I don't really have to think long about a design what I want. but most of the time it's a basic design and not a really hard one.<br>I also think I have grown a lot. I started to ask more feedback, and let people look at my work more which I think is good.<br></p><br>
        <p>I also presented all our projects to try and get better in presenting because I think I am not good at presenting. I also don't like it. but the more I presented, the better it is going. I can tell about my work but I just don't like to do it in front of a whole class</p></div>
