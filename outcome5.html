        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>I want to continue with this study and see where it is going to bring me. I like this profile and I want to find out what more things I can do with it. In the future I don't know what I want to be yet but I think I will know further in this study. Right now I prefer the designing and development part.<br><br> I also reflected on my work and what I personally could do better in previous projects and tried to apply this to my recent work. The main part I wanted to work on is to organize my stuff better, and to not do everything last minute. </p>
