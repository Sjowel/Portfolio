        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p> I first started with making the lay-out in Figma, the place where I wanted everything to be and how I wanted to make everything clear. After I made the lay-out, I was looking for inspiration for my portfolio, how I wanted to design it. I put everything in a document and made my design in Figma. I did usertests on this and changed things based on the feedback I got.<br><br></p>

        <p>For example some feedback I got was at the background of my homepage, I had a skyline of New York, They told me it was better for me to do a skyline of Maastricht, because that's where I'm from.<br> So I was searching for a good skyline of Maastricht, and then I photoshopped the purple color on it so it matches my theme. Below the iterations.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/Afbeelding1.png" id="concepten" style="width: 700px"><br><br>
        <p>After I made the front page design I went further with the rest of the design. I wanted this to be more basic but also clear.<br> My first design was the gradient I had used for the frontpage, but all the way to the bottom. I got as feedback that it could be annoying to work with and it didn't look really professional. After I got this feedback I made the lay-out white with purple buttons, I did usertests on this and I got as feedback that it was boring and it wasn't really in my theme.<br> After this feedback I decided to make the background a very light purple so I kept using the puprle and make the buttons a little lighter purple. </p><br>
            <img src="images/LayOutDesign.png" id="layout" style="width: 600px"><br><br>
        <p>After I made this design, I went further with the interaction of the buttons. What do I want the buttons to do when you press it and how do I want the lay-out of the next page when you press it.<br> My first idea was to make a page with one project and in the header make a button to go back to the home page so you can go to the learning outcomes. But I got as feedback that it was detour so not very useful.<br> Then I went back to Figma to make different designs which I did usertests on several people, and the general feedback was, just make a page for each project, explain the project, and on the pages of the learning outcomes, explain what you did per project, per learning outcome. that's how I came on my design which I have now.<br><br></p>

        <h3>Project 1: Branding<br></h3>
        <p>For the first project I started with making logo designs on paper for the SoundLab. I searched for inspiration on the internet and then I started drawing. I made 6 designs on paper:<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/Illustraties.jpg" id="foto" style="width: 300px"><br><br>
        <p>After everyone made the designs, we let the stakeholder decide which one was the best. from my designs he choose the third one, but I also got some feedback on it. He liked that it looked like a headset but  it was weird that in the middle was a little hole between 1 wave, so I had to fix that. After I got this feedback I went further on Adobe Illustrator to make an actual logo design on the computer.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/LogoOntwerpen.png" id="logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>I made 3 different designs based on the logo the stakeholder had chosen. After I made these designs I let some people choose 1 of the 3, and the top one was the one which was chosen the most. After this all the logos we made were put together and the best logo was chosen.</p><br>
            <img src="images/GrooveRoom1.png" id="Logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>When we finally had the logo we asked the stakeholder for feedback, he told us that he didn't really like the LPs, and wanted the o's of Groove Room te have something simular to what the SoundLab is used for. So I decided to make a sketch of the logo and just make things with it in Adobe Illustrator.</p><br>
            <img src="images/grooveroomscetch.png" id="scetch" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We liked the play and pause button in my scetch so we decided to use that in the actual logo.<br> We also made 11 stylescapes to decide the actual colour we want our logo to be, because we didn't know if the blue/purple was very inviting. I made the second, third and fourth stylescape. I wanted to go for a Neon look and a natural look.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Stylescape1.png" id="Sylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><img src="images/Stylescape.png" id="stylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We once again asked feedback from the stakeholder and asked him which 3 of all the stylescapes he prefered. he choose the first, fourth and tenth ones. After we had our 3 three stylescapes we put the two we thought would fit the soundlab more into a survey with a logo in these colours and let our target audience fill this survey in.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Survey.png" id="survey" style="width: 500px;"><br><br>
        <p>The feedback we got was that the first one was more inviting and gave a warmer feeling, and if the SoundLab would have that logo people would go there faster.<br> When we had our colours and our logo we decided to combine our new logo design with the current colours.</p><br>
            <img src="images/logo2.png" id="logo" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>I learned to do good research to get to the answers and apply these answers to my project, and based on the answers I can make new versions of the things I'm making.</p><br>
