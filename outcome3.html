        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p> I first started with making the lay-out in Figma, the place where I wanted everything to be and how I wanted to make everything clear. After I made the lay-out, I was looking for inspiration for my portfolio, how I wanted to design it. I put everything in a document and made my design in Figma. I did usertests on this and changed things based on the feedback I got.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/FigmaDesign.png" id="Figma" style="width: 700px; " ><br><br>
        <p> I did usertests on a classmate for this design, and since this isn't the target audience for my portfolio I used the feedback but I didn't use the usertest. I learned from this mistake and next time I'm going to do a usertest on my target audience.</p>
        <p>For example some feedback I got in my first portfolio review from Stan, was in the background of my homepage, I had a skyline of New York, He told me it was better for me to do a skyline of Maastricht, because that's where I'm from.<br> So I was searching for a good skyline of Maastricht, and then I photoshopped the purple color on it so it matches my theme. Below the iterations.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/Afbeelding1.png" id="concepten" style="width: 700px"><br><br>
        <p>After the first review I got as feedback from my coaches that it was a good idea to make a moodboard with things I liked so I could get a better Idea of what I wanted on my website. so that's what I did.</p>
            <img src="images/Moodboard.png" id="moodboard" style="width: 500px;"><br><br>
        <p>After I made the front page design I went further with the rest of the design. I wanted this to be more basic but also clear.<br> My first design was the gradient I had used for the frontpage, but all the way to the bottom. I got as feedback from Stan that it could be annoying to work with and it didn't look really professional. After I got this feedback I made the lay-out white with purple buttons, I did asked around on this design (also not the target audience but classmates) and I got as feedback that it was boring and it wasn't really in my theme.<br> After this feedback I decided to make the background a very light purple so I kept using the puprle and make the buttons a little lighter purple. </p><br>
            <img src="images/LayOutDesign.png" id="layout" style="width: 600px"><br><br>
        <p>After I made this design, I went further with the interaction of the buttons. What do I want the buttons to do when you press it and how do I want the lay-out of the next page when you press it.<br> My first idea was to make a page with one project and in the header make a button to go back to the home page so you can go to the learning outcomes. But I got as feedback that it was detour so not very useful.<br> Then I went back to Figma to make different designs which I did usertests on several people, and the general feedback was, just make a page for each project, explain the project, and on the pages of the learning outcomes, explain what you did per project, per learning outcome. that's how I came on my design which I have now.<br><br></p>

            <img src="images/LODesign.png" id="LO" style="width: 478px"><br><br>
        <p>I learned to first start with doing research or making a moodboard for the design I want so I can make a design faster and it won't take that much time. and to do usertests on the target audience and don't do it on random people who aren't the target audience. I can ask feedback from them but don't do usertests on them.</P>

        <h3>Project 1: Branding<br></h3>
        <p>For the first project I started with making logo designs on paper for the SoundLab. I searched for inspiration on the internet and then I started drawing. I made 6 designs on paper:<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/Illustraties.jpg" id="foto" style="width: 300px"><br><br>
        <p>After everyone made the designs, we let the stakeholder decide which one was the best. from my designs he choose the third one, but I also got some feedback on it. He liked that it looked like a headset but  it was weird that in the middle was a little hole between 1 wave, so I had to fix that. After I got this feedback I went further on Adobe Illustrator to make an actual logo design on the computer.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/LogoOntwerpen.png" id="logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>I made 3 different designs based on the logo the stakeholder had chosen. After I made these designs I let some people choose 1 of the 3, and the top one was the one which was chosen the most. After this all the logos we made were put together and the best logo was chosen.</p><br>
            <img src="images/GrooveRoom1.png" id="Logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>When we finally had the logo we asked the stakeholder for feedback, he told us that he didn't really like the LPs, and wanted the o's of Groove Room te have something simular to what the SoundLab is used for. So I decided to make a sketch of the logo and just make things with it in Adobe Illustrator.</p><br>
            <img src="images/grooveroomscetch.png" id="scetch" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We liked the play and pause button in my scetch so we decided to use that in the actual logo.<br> We also made 11 stylescapes to decide the actual colour we want our logo to be, because we didn't know if the blue/purple was very inviting. I made the second, third and fourth stylescape. I wanted to go for a Neon look and a natural look.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Stylescape1.png" id="Sylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><img src="images/Stylescape.png" id="stylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We once again asked feedback from the stakeholder and asked him which 3 of all the stylescapes he prefered. he choose the first, fourth and tenth ones. After we had our 3 three stylescapes we put the two we thought would fit the soundlab more into a survey with a logo in these colours and let our target audience fill this survey in.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Survey.png" id="survey" style="width: 500px;"><br><br>
        <p>The feedback we got was that the first one was more inviting and gave a warmer feeling, and if the SoundLab would have that logo people would go there faster.<br> When we had our colours and our logo we decided to combine our new logo design with the current colours.</p><br>
            <img src="images/logo2.png" id="logo" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>I learned to do good research to get to the answers and apply these answers to my project, and based on the answers I can make new and better versions of the things I'm making.</p><br>
        <h3>Project x</h3>
        <p>For project X I wanted to make something where I could make good iterative designs on because this was something I wasn't good at for my feeling. I never really did good usertests or asked good feedback to make my design better. so that was my plan with this project.
            I first started doing some research about writing websites. You can find that at <a href="outcome4.html"><strong>Learning Outcome 4</strong></a>. So I could already make My first design.<br></p>
            <img src="images/iteratie1.png" id="iteratie1" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>After I made the first design I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pzh2UPKbR9Gkhl0dG_kG0leSH5NmUCUrghtT4QwEMj0/edit#responses" target="_blank"><strong>Survey</strong></a> So I could look what the target audience prefers and I could make a new design on that. Basically, the most common answer out of the survey was to make a light and dark mode, so I copies my design and made it into a dark mode.</p>
            <img src="images/Iteratie2.png" id="iteratie2" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>When I was done with this, I did my first usertest on a person who uses writing websites a lot. You can find these usertests also at <a href="outcome4.html"><strong>Learning Outcome 4</strong></a>. these changes were not that big because I didn't have to change it on all pages. I added a settings button on the landing page so it was easier to change the dark and light mode</p>
            <img src="images/Iteratie3.png" id="iteratie3" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>Later Based on feedback I got from Paul who also did my usertest, (isn't in my target audience but is my coach I didn't count it as usertest but put it in the changes) I changed the settings button on the landing page to a moonbutton in the navigation bar so you can change between dark and light mode fast and whenever you want.</p>
            <img src="images/Iteratie4.png" id="iteratie4" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>After this I did 2 more usertests on my target audience. The feedback was kind of the same as the first person. but the third person said she didn't like the landing page to be a 'create' button, but she thought it would be a better idea to make the browse page the landing page. I changed this.</p>
            <img src="images/Iteratie5.png" id="iteratie5" style="width: 400px;"><br><br>
        <p>I asked user 1 what she was thinking about the change of the landing page and she also prefered the browse page, because maybe you're not going to this website to create your own stories but just to read stories from other people.<br><br></p>
            <p>I learned that it's good to ask more people than just 1 about the designs your making so you have different opinions about everthing. The annoying thing is that not everyone agrees with each other so you also have to made your own choices, but that's where iterations are good for. To see if you like something you make.</p>
