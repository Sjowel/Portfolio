        <h3>Project 1: Branding<br><br></h3>
        <p>For the first project I started with making logo designs on paper for the SoundLab. I searched for inspiration on the internet and then I started drawing. I made 6 designs on paper:<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/Illustraties.jpg" id="foto" style="width: 300px"><br><br>
        <p>After everyone made the designs, we let the stakeholder decide which one was the best. from my designs he choose the third one, but I also got some feedback on it. He liked that it looked like a headset but  it was weird that in the middle was a little hole between 1 wave, so I had to fix that. After I got this feedback I went further on Adobe Illustrator to make an actual logo design on the computer.<br><br></p>
            <img src="images/LogoOntwerpen.png" id="logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>I made 3 different designs based on the logo the stakeholder had chosen. After I made these designs I let some people choose 1 of the 3, and the top one was the one which was chosen the most. After this all the logos we made were put together and the best logo was chosen.</p><br>
            <img src="images/GrooveRoom1.png" id="Logo" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>When we finally had the logo we asked the stakeholder for feedback, he told us that he didn't really like the LPs, and wanted the o's of Groove Room te have something simular to what the SoundLab is used for. So I decided to make a sketch of the logo and just make things with it in Adobe Illustrator.</p><br>
            <img src="images/grooveroomscetch.png" id="scetch" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We liked the play and pause button in my scetch so we decided to use that in the actual logo.<br> We also made 11 stylescapes to decide the actual colour we want our logo to be, because we didn't know if the blue/purple was very inviting. I made the second, third and fourth stylescape. I wanted to go for a Neon look and a natural look.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Stylescape1.png" id="Sylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><img src="images/Stylescape.png" id="stylescape" style="width: 300px;"><br><br>
        <p>We once again asked feedback from the stakeholder and asked him which 3 of all the stylescapes he prefered. he choose the first, fourth and tenth ones. After we had our 3 three stylescapes we put the two we thought would fit the soundlab more into a survey with a logo in these colours and let our target audience fill this survey in.</p><br>
            <img src="images/Survey.png" id="survey" style="width: 500px;"><br><br>
        <p>The feedback we got was that the first one was more inviting and gave a warmer feeling, and if the SoundLab would have that logo people would go there faster.<br> When we had our colours and our logo we decided to combine our new logo design with the current colours.</p><br>
