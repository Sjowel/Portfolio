        <h2>Professional Standard</h2>
        <p>"You apply professional practice, both individually and in teams, in the areas of project organisation, communication with stakeholders, exploratory research, and reporting."</p><br><br>
        <h3>Project 1: Branding</h3>
        <p>For the first project we made a team charter together with measures and guiding principles. <br> Open the team charter here: <a href="images/TeamCharter.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>PDF</strong></a></p><br><br>
        <h3>Project 2: Media Campaign</h3>
        <p>I made interview questions for an interview we had with the marketing department of Fontys, we also worked this interview out in a summary. I summarized the first part of the interview and a groupmate summarized the last part. Here is the <a href="images/Interview.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Interview</strong></a>.<br><br> we sent out a survey to ICT Deeltijd semester 1, so we would find out what the age would be of the people who do that study, what they studied before and how they found this study. Here are the answers of the <a href="images/Interview.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>enquête</strong></a>.<br><br> We also went to Fontys TQ where the ICT Deeltijd study is, and we interviewed a total of five ICT Deeltijd students about the study and how they got there. Me and a groupmate interviewed 3 students which we both also summarized. Here are those <a href="images/InterviewsDeeltijdstudenten.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Interviews</strong></a>.</p><br>
        <p>I learned that it's a good thing to do interviews or enquêtes with the target audience to get a clearer view of what they think of something so we can make everything we do to their interests, and don't rely on what you think is best if you're not the target audience because it will not work.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Project 3: Development</h3>
        <p>For the development project we discussed verbally who was going to do what. We didn't wrote it down, but one person was going to make the home page, one person the two year study and one person the four year study. We decided to make it in a shared VS Code document.</p><br>
        <p>For the next time it is better to write down what someone is supposed to do. That way no one can be wrong in what they have to do and everything is clear.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Project X</h3><br>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>Based on the team charter we made for the first project, we tried to keep the agreements we made also for the other projects. when people didn't stick to the agreements we talked with them and if this didn't work we talked with the coaches. </p>
